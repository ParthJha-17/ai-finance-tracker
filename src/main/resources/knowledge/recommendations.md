## 50/30/20 Budget
Allocate 50% of net income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings or debt payoff. If goals require faster progress, reduce wants to increase savings.

## Emergency Fund
Build 3–6 months of essential expenses in a liquid savings account. Prioritize this before aggressive investing if cash reserves are low.

## Debt Avalanche
Pay minimums on all debts, then direct extra cash to the highest interest rate first. Best for minimizing total interest paid.

## Debt Snowball
Pay minimums on all debts, then direct extra cash to the smallest balance first. Best for motivation and momentum.

## Sinking Funds
Create dedicated sub-savings for upcoming expenses (annual insurance, holidays, travel). This reduces reliance on credit cards.

## Needs vs Wants Audit
Classify recurring expenses as needs (housing, utilities, basic groceries) or wants (dining out, subscriptions). Trim wants to free funds for goals.

## Pay Yourself First
Automate transfers to savings/investments immediately after income hits, ensuring progress toward goals before discretionary spending.

## Goal Mapping Framework
Match goals to time horizons: short-term (0–2 years) should be in cash or high-yield savings, mid-term (2–5 years) in conservative investments, long-term (5+ years) can tolerate higher volatility.

## Expense Optimization
Review top spending categories monthly, negotiate recurring bills, and set caps on discretionary categories to align with goals.
